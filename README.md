# Description:
Yaari Talk is a chat application that I built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The idea was to create a simple, WhatsApp-like chat system that can run directly in the browser without needing any backend or database. The app has a built-in bot that can reply to user messages with different responses, so it feels like chatting with a real AI assistant.

This project helped me practice frontend development, UI/UX design, and JavaScript logic building. It also shows how to create an interactive and user-friendly app with only frontend technologies.

# Features:

 Chatbot that can reply to user questions.

 WhatsApp-style interface with chat bubbles, timestamps, and a clean layout.

 Typing indicator to make conversations look more real.

 Works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

 Fully frontend → no server needed.

 Can be hosted on GitHub Pages or Netlify and shared with a link.

 Technologies Used

 HTML5 → structure of the app

 CSS3 → styling and responsive design

 JavaScript (ES6) → chatbot logic, event handling, DOM updates

 # What I Learned

Building a real-world style UI with pure frontend.

Handling events and updating the DOM in JavaScript.

Making apps that are responsive and mobile-friendly.

How to simulate AI-like conversations without backend.
